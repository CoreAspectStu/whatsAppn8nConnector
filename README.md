## n8n Integration

### Setting up the n8n Workflow

1. In n8n, create a new workflow with a webhook node
2. Configure the webhook path to match what you specified in the instance configuration
3. Add your AI processing nodes (OpenAI, logic, etc.)
4. Return responses in this format:
   ```json
   {
     "output": "The response text to send to WhatsApp"
   }
   ```

### Testing the Integration

Send a message to one of your allowed WhatsApp users or groups. The connector will:
1. Receive the message
2. Forward it to the corresponding n8n workflow
3. Send the AI-generated response back to WhatsApp
